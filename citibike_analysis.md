### Analysis - Des Moines Population & Comparison
The cities of Des Moines and NYC are vastly different in their industries, size, tourism, and infrastructure. [This presentation](https://public.tableau.com/profile/joe.merkel3071#!/vizhome/TableauBike/DesMoines) visualizes population data and provides insight in how the population differences may impact and provide unique opportunities for an expansion into Des Moines.

In summary, Des Moines has a much smaller population and is built much less dense. Despite this, a couple metrics in Des Moines may point to success, those metrics being a large population growth, and a large portion of the population being under 18.


### Population Difference/Density
This page gives an overview of the general population size and density of NYC and Des Moines. From what we can see, there are about 8x as many people in NYC as Des Moines, and they are compressed into a much smaller area of land. This density is outlined in the main graph showing that Des Moines square mile density is 2,516 while NYC is nearly 70 thousand.

These two charts provide a very clear view that the density and population of these cities differ wildly.

### Growth
This page provides a source of optimism for the viability of CitiBike in Des Moines. Despite having a smaller population, the city is growing at a much higher rate than NYC. Additionally, the percentage of the population that is under 18 is much higher in Des Moines. These facts are important as people under 18 are less likely to have the financial assets for cars and may be more reliant on alternative transportation. The large population growth is also a boon for CitiBike as whenever there is population growth, traffic will increase. If this occurs, more people may rely on CitiBike for commuting, errands, or other transportation needs.

### Number of Bikes
The Number of Bikes page attempts to show the assets used in NYC. From the NYC Analysis, there are just under 14,000 bikes. Coupled with the census information, this provides a high end demand for bikes of 1,750 (as this corresponds with the population size in Des Moines compared to NYC). This would be a high end estimate as the low density of Des Moines will most likely cause the number of bikes to be clustered in fewer, more populous areas.


### Unclear & Additional information
Many of the other census data is not applicable at this time due to lack of information. Though demographic details are available for the city, that information is not available in the CitiBike Data (ethnicity of each rider, purpose of bike rental, age of rider). Additional research may be necessary and should focus on the other Major questions the group came up with.
